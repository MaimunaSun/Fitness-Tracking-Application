# Fitness-Tracking-Application
This project is a privacy-focused fitness tracking application developed in Java for Android devices. It performs on-device activity recognition using accelerometer sensor data, removing the need for costly wearables or cloud-based computation. By processing data locally, the app ensures user privacy while reducing infrastructure costs and dependency on internet connectivity.

The application is built using Android Architecture Components, including ViewModel, LiveData, and Room ORM, to promote a robust, modular, and maintainable architecture. Accelerometer data is collected at a frequency of 20Hz in overlapping 5-second windows. A real-time data pipeline was developed to handle the full lifecycle: from acquiring and preprocessing sensor data, extracting relevant features, classifying the activity using a machine learning model, and storing the predicted activity labels in a local SQLite database using Room.

The detected activity (e.g., walking, jogging, sitting) is logged in the background and displayed in real time on a user-friendly interface. The ViewModel ensures that activity logs with timestamps are reflected immediately in the UI. The app also provides personalized insights such as total active and inactive time and estimated calories burned. These insights are computed based on both the activity data and the user's profile information. When a user updates their profile, all insights are recalculated accordingly.

To support ethical data governance, the app ensures compliance with the Protection of Personal Information (POPI) Act by keeping all user data on-device and implementing responsible AI practices in the handling, storage, and processing of activity data. Privacy and security were core design principles throughout the development process.

The use of Room ORM simplifies database operations by mapping SQLite tables to Java objects, allowing for clean and efficient data access. Overall, the app demonstrates a complete on-device machine learning pipeline for mobile activity recognition, with a focus on performance, privacy, and ethical data handling.
