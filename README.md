# Fitness-Tracking-Application
This project involves designing and developing a fitness tracking app in Java, integrating a machine learning-based activity recognition model to monitor users' physical activities. This fitness tracking app is built using Android Architecture Components to ensure the system is robust, testable, and easy to maintain. The app collects accelerometer sensor data at 20Hz in overlapping 5-second windows. Each 5-second window includes 100 samples, which are processed by a machine learning model to detect the user's physical activity (e.g., walking, jogging). The detected activity is saved in the background to a local SQLite database using Room ORM, through a repository and ViewModel. The ViewModel updates the UI in real time, showing the user's activity log with timestamps. Activity insights like total active time, inactive time, and estimated calories burned are calculated and displayed in the Insights UI. These insights depend on both the activity data and the user's profile information. When a user updates their profile, the insights are also updated automatically. The Room ORM simplifies database operations by mapping SQLite tables to Java objects, allowing clean and efficient data access.
